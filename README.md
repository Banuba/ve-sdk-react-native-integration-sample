# [DEPRECATED] Banuba Video Editor SDK - React Native Expo-CLI integration sample.

## Overview
[Banuba Video Editor SDK](https://www.banuba.com/video-editor-sdk) allows you to quickly add short video functionality and possibly AR filters and effects into your mobile app.
<br>  
The sample demonstrates how to run Video Editor SDK with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo-CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/).  

:exclamation: This sample is no longer supported.  
This sample and the SDK itself do not have any specific implementation or configuration for ReactNative Expo.
Please use [ReactNative-CLI Sample](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-react-native-cli-integration-sample) as a sample for integrating Video Editor SDK into ReactNative project.
